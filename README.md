# gfv2-params

Geospatial analysis project using GDAL, rasterio, geopandas, and interactive scripting with [Marimo](https://marimo.io).

This project uses a hybrid environment setup:

- **Conda**: for binary dependencies (GDAL, PROJ, rasterio, etc.)
- **uv**: for Python-only packages from `pyproject.toml`
- **Marimo**: I jupyter replacement, mostly used in this context for interactive experimenting and for generating plots as a check on the processing.
---

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

### 1. Create and activate the Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geoenv
```
### 2. Install project dependencies with uv and install pre-commit

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

This will install all project.dependencies defined in pyproject.toml.

## Updating the Environment

If you add/remove Python packages in pyproject.toml:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade
```

if you update the binary stack in environment.yml:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

## ðŸš€ Using Marimo

Marimo notebooks are stored in the marimo/ directory.  The are used for experimenting with workflow processing.

To run a notebook:

```bash
marimo run marimo/your_notebook.py
```

This will start a Jupyter server and open the notebook in your browser.
You can also run the notebook in a terminal:

```bash
marimo run marimo/your_notebook.py --terminal
```

This will run the notebook in a terminal and print the output to the console.

To launch the interactive GUI for development:

```bash
marimo edit

# or edit a specific file

merimo edit marimo/your_notebook.py
```

This will start a Jupyter server and open the Marimo GUI in your browser.
You can then create new notebooks, run existing notebooks, and manage your environment.

## ðŸ§  Tips

- Use conda list to inspect installed packages and verify version compatibility.
- Avoid mixing the same package between conda and uv (e.g., don't install gdal via pip).
- Pin versions in pyproject.toml only when needed (e.g., "marimo>=0.4").
- Use uv to manage Python dependencies and conda for binary dependencies.
- Use Marimo for interactive scripting and reproducible workflows.

## ðŸ§° Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with uv, try the following:

- if a package fails to install via uv, check if it has binary dependencies. If so, prefer installing it via conda.
